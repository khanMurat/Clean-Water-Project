# Clean water Project

A new Flutter project.

This project was carried out in order to draw attention to clean water access, which is one of the sustainable development plans published by the United Nations, and to support water well projects aimed at solving this problem.

In this project, you can see ongoing water well projects, and not only you can read stories about people who live in villages where they can't access clean water properly, but also donate to these projects.

I used firebase authentication for the user login and register process in this project.Moreover I fetched data about water well projects from firebase firestore database.
To State Management,Provider was used.
To Cache process,Shared Preferences was used.
MVVM Architecture
Singelton Design Pattern etc.


Design belongs to me and to see more information check this website -- https://lifewater.org/
